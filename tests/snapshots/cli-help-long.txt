Create virtual serial ports, connect them to physical serial ports, and create routes between them all.

Usage: vsp-router [OPTIONS]

Options:
      --virtual <VIRTUAL>
          Create a virtual serial port.
          
          The argument takes the following form: '[<id>:]<path>'
          
          If no ID is specified, the ID is set to the basename of the path.
          
          Can use multiple times to create multiple virtual serial ports.
          
          Examples:
          
          --virtual path/to/file
          
              The path is 'path/to/file' and the ID is 'file'.
          
          --virtual 0:dev/ttyUSB0
          
              The path is '/dev/ttyUSB0' and the ID is '0'.

      --physical <PHYSICAL>
          Open a physical serial port.
          
          The argument takes the following form: '[<id>:]<path>[,<baud-rate>]'
          
          If ID is not specified, the ID is set to the basename of the path. If baud rate is not specified,
          the baud rate defaults to 9600.
          
          Can use multiple times to attached multiple physical serial ports.
          
          Examples:
          
          --physical /dev/ttyUSB0
          
              The path is '/dev/ttyUSB0', the ID is 'ttyUSB0', and the baud rate is 9600.
          
          --physical 1:/dev/ttyUSB0
          
              The path is '/dev/ttyUSB0', the ID is '1', and the baud rate is 9600.
          
          --physical 1:/dev/ttyUSB0,115200
          
              The path is '/dev/ttyUSB0', the ID is '1', and the baud rate is 115200.

      --route <ROUTE>
          Create a route between a source port and a destination port.
          
          The argument takes the following form: '<src-id>:<dst-id>'
          
          Can use multiple times to create multiple routes.
          
          Examples:
          
          --route 0:1
          
              The source ID is '0' and the destination ID is '1'.

  -h, --help
          Print help (see a summary with '-h')

  -V, --version
          Print version


Examples:

    Share a physical serial port with two virtual serial ports.

    Data sent from virtual serial port 0 is sent to the physical serial port but not to virtual
    serial port 1.  Similarly, data sent from virtual serial port 1 is sent to the physical serial
    port but not to virtual serial port 0.  Data received from the physical serial port is sent to
    both virtual serial ports.
